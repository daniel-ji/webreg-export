# UCSD WebReg Export App

A simple web app to export your WebReg schedule to an ICS file, which can then be imported into Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.

Built using a React frontend and a Express & Node backend. Parses provided html data with regular expressions to then construct a ICS file. 

Created by: Daniel Ji (daji@ucsd.edu) with the help of Owen Miller, Emmett Pangan, Ethan Han, and Zakir Alibhai.
